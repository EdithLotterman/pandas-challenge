    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overall, the majority (65%) of students in PyCity are proficient in both math and reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Per pupil spending doesn't appear to be a major driver of academic returns, as the overall passing rate for the lowest-spending schools is 36 percentage points (90% vs 54%) higher than the most expensive school.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The analysis lacks student socio-demographic information, which would be needed to analyze the link between per pupil spending and results. It is possible that higher-spending schools have a higher proportion of special-needs students who require more expensive learning supports while still tending towards lower scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Smaller schools and charter school both outperformed. Given the level of anlaysis performed, it is impossible to say which is the larger driving factor. The analysis of best-performing schools versus lowest-performing schools shows that the best-performing schools are charter schools whose student populations are well below the lowest performing schools. I recommend the district undertake further research to determine if the driving factor is pedagogical differences between school types, or if district schools could have similar results be decreasing the size of its high schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The lack of student demographic information is a substantial limitation of the analysis. Possible charter school admission policies and/or disciplinary policy differences could result in substantial differences in the student populations relatice to the district which must serve all students.
